# jobHunter
The goal of this game project is to relearn the fundamentals of python and remind myself what it takes to find work in the modern world.

The goal of jobHunter is to find gainful employment!  This will be done in the style of a classic text adventure game.  

I will add development notes to the README as I progress.

As a tutorial for myself i'm using https://coding-grace-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/lessonplans/beginners-python-text-based-adventure.html to get this thing started.
