# jobHunter
The goal of this game project is to relearn the fundamentals of python and remind myself what it takes to find work in the modern world.

The goal of jobHunter is to find gainful employment!  This will be done in the style of a classic text adventure game.  

I will add development notes to the README as I progress.

As a tutorial for myself i'm using https://coding-grace-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/lessonplans/beginners-python-text-based-adventure.html to get this thing started.

For starters we'll have a welcome message that posts the rules of the game, it will also ask the player for their name and store it.  
The player can do several actions:
1) Check Email (Any responses to applications )
2) Apply to a job (Should add option to try to find and follow up an app with a outreach ) 
3) Cultural Practice (Practice for Cultural interviews)
4) Tech Practice (Prepare for tech interviews)
5) Vidya Games (Another time waster but will lower stress/anxiety levels)
6) Sleep (this will bring the next day, possible chance of email response and interview inquiries

There will be two stats - Energy and Stress:
Energy - At some point in the day you'll run out of energy and be forced to sleep.
Stress - If your stress level gets too high you may suffer from various penalties up to losing an entire day. 

There are two interview skillsets - Cultural and Technical - Each can be leveled up with practice to improve chances of success in job interviews

More forthcoming...
